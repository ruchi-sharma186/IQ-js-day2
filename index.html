    <h3 >Ques1. What are objects in javascript?</h3>
    <p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality <br>
    ( which usually consists of several varialbes and function - <br>
    which are called propeties and methods when they are inside objects.)</p>

<hr>
    <h3 >Ques2.What are function?</h3>
    <p>A function in JavaScript is a block of code designed to perform a task. You can call (run) the function whenever you need it.</p>
    <h4>there are 3 way of create a function</h4>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Regular function</li>
    <li>Arrow function</li>
    <li>function Expression</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h3 > Ques3.What is an event loop and call stack.</h3>
<p> call stack is a way for the JavaScript engine to keep track of its place in code that calls multiple functions. <br>
     It has information on what function is being run and what functions are invoked from within that function.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 > Ques4. What is the DOM?</h3>
<p>It's a tree-like structure that the browser creates from your HTML. <br>
    It represents the web page as objects that JavaScript can access and manipulate. <br>
    So, the DOM lets you change HTML, CSS, or content with JavaScript!</p>
    <h2 id="title">Welcome!</h2>
    <h2 id="title">Hello, World!</h2>
    <hr>
<h3> Ques5.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
 <h4>undefined</h4>
 <p>
     A variable is declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. <br>
     type: undefined
    Who gives its?: JavaScript automatically assigns it.</p>
    <h4>not defined</h4>
    <p>
        Meaning: A variable has not been declared at all in the scope. <br>
Type: ReferenceError <br>

Who gives it?: JavaScript engine throws an error when trying to access it.
    </p>
    <h4>NaN  (Not a Number)</h4>
    <P>
       
        Meaning: It's a special value that represents a result that is not a valid number.
        
        Type: number
        
        When it happens?: Usually from an invalid math operation.
    </P>

    <h3>Question 6: What are arrow functions?</h3>
    <p>Arrow functions are a concise way to define functions using =>, and they donâ€™t have their own this context.</p>
 <hr>
    <h3>Question 7: What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h3>
    <p>The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object</p>
    <pre>
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
for (let key in obj) {
    console.log(key, obj[key]);
}
    </pre>
<hr>
    <h3>Question 8: Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain</h3>
    <p><strong>Local Scope:</strong> Local scope means that a variable is accessible only inside the function where it is defined.<br>
       <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Block scope applies to variables declared with let or const inside a pair of curly braces {} like in if, for, etc.<br>
       <strong>Functional Scope:</strong>This means variables declared with var are limited to the entire function, not just inside the block.<br>
       <strong>Scope Chain:</strong> \The scope chain is the process JS uses to look for variables: it starts from the current scope and moves outward until it finds the variable.</p>
<hr>
    <h3>Question 9: Difference between null and undefined</h3>
    <p><strong>null:</strong>  "This variable has no value on purpose."<br>
       <strong>undefined:</strong>A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value</p>
<hr>
    <h3>Question 10: map and filter example</h3>
    <p><strong>map:</strong>  "creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array."<br>
        <strong>filter:</strong>creates a new array that contains only the elements that pass a certain condition (return true in the callback).</p>
       <pre>
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Using map to square each number
const squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);

// Using filter to get only even numbers
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log("Original array:", numbers);
console.log("Squares (map):", squares);
console.log("Even numbers (filter):", evens);
       </pre> <hr>
    <h3>Question 11: Count 0's in an array</h3>
    <pre >
        const binaryArray = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0];

        let zeroCount = 0;
        
        for (let num of binaryArray) {
            if (num === 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
        }
        
        console.log("Array:", binaryArray);
        console.log("Number of 0's:", zeroCount);</pre>
<hr>
    <h3>Question 12: Count odd and even numbers in an array</h3>
    <pre >
        const numbers = [10, 23, 44, 55, 66, 71, 80];

        let oddCount = 0;
        let evenCount = 0;
        
        for (let num of numbers) {
            if (num % 2 === 0) {
                evenCount++;
            } else {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        
        console.log("Array:", numbers);
        console.log("Even numbers:", evenCount);
        console.log("Odd numbers:", oddCount);</pre>

    <h3>Question 13: Count vowels in a string</h3>
    <pre>let a="prepbytes";
        let count =0;
        for (let i=0;i<=a.length;i++)
        {
           let ch=a[i];
           if(ch==='a'||ch==='e'||ch==='i'||ch==='o'||ch==='u'||ch==='A'||ch==='E'||ch==='I'||ch==='O'||ch==='U')
           {
               count++;
           }
        }
        console.log(count)</pre> <hr>
